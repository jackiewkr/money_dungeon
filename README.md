# The Money Dungeon!


The Money Dungeon is a game where you aim your bow and shoot. The objective of
a level is to hit the chest (the target). A successful hit will complete the
level, rewarding you with money. You can fire as many arrows as you want, but
beware as the more arrows you fire, the less reward you will get!

Each level can have different wind conditions that affect your throw, so be
careful!
